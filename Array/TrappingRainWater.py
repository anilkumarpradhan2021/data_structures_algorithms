Trapping Rain Water

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

Examples:

Input: arr[]   = {2, 0, 2}
Output: 2
Structure is like below
| |
|_|
We can trap 2 units of water in the middle gap.

Input: arr[]   = {3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 4}
Output: 10
Structure is like below
     |
|    |
|  | |
|__|_| 
We can trap "3*2 units" of water between 3 an 2,
"1 unit" on top of bar 2 and "3 units" between 2 
and 4.  See below diagram also.

Input: arr[] = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]
Output: 6
       | 
   |   || |
_|_||_||||||
Trap "1 unit" between first 1 and 2, "4 units" between
first 2 and 3 and "1 unit" between second last 1 and last 2
