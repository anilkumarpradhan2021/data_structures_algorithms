Problem :  
1 . Find the articulation point in a undirected graph 
2. Find the bridge in a graph

ARTICULATION POINT :
A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point (or cut vertex) 
iff removing it (and edges through it) disconnects the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities 
in a connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the network into 2 or more disconnected components. 
They are useful for designing reliable networks.


BRIDGE :
An edge in an undirected connected graph is a bridge iff removing it disconnects the graph.
For a disconnected undirected graph, definition is similar, a bridge is an edge removing which increases number 
of connected components.


In DFS tree, a vertex u is articulation point if one of the following two conditions is true.
1) u is root of DFS tree and it has at least two independent children.
2) u is not root of DFS tree and it has a child v such that no vertex in subtree rooted with v has a back edge to one of the ancestors (in DFS tree) of u. 
    i.e discovery time <= low time of adjacent vertex
    discovery_time[u] <= low_time[v]
   
   
1 .Start from any vertex and do DFS  
2. For each vertex increase 
    2.2 Discovery time 
    2.3 Low time
    2.3 update adjacent vertex with updated time.
3 . Call DFS for all adjacent vertex
    3.1 each time update the low time if adjacent vertex have low time
    3.2  check for Case -1 if it is root and number of individual children > 1
    3.3  Case-2 Its not root and discovery_time of vertex is less than and equal to low time of adjacent vertex i.e  discovery_time[u] <= low_time[adj_v] 
4. Continue step-2 to 3 for all vertex
